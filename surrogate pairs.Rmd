For all those who have been struggling with the surrogate pairs.
It turns out there are some problems with the code Celine shared with us, and I thought I would say how to fix (some of) them.
Thanks to Karl and his group for helping!
Step 1: There can be some problems with the working directory, for those of us who are not used to changing it all the time. I solved this by just putting all my files into the main folder where my working directory is by default and working from there.
Step 2: Sometimes, the line
pairs=as.numeric(unique(df$V2))
Can give some trouble. A way to fix this is by changing it to
pairs=as.numeric(unique(as.numeric(as.character(df$V2))))
Step 3:
In the end of the code, there are four sets of code each looking something like this:
d5=data.frame(Resp1=d1$Resp1,Resp2=d2$Resp1,HR1=d1$HR1,HR2=d2$HR1,Resp1S=d1$Resp1S,Resp2S=d2$Resp1S,HR1S=d1$HR1S,HR2S=d2$HR1S)
They should be changed to look like this:
d5=data.frame(Resp1=d1$Resp1,Resp2=d2$Resp1,HR1=d1$HR1,HR2=d2$HR1,Resp1S=d1$Resp1,Resp2S=d2$Resp1,HR1S=d1$HR1,HR2S=d2$HR1)
(Deleting the S'es after the dollar signs, but not the ones before)
Remember to do it for all four sets of code.
Step 4:
There has to be a folder called "surrogate" in the working directory for the files to be put in
Good luck!
